#What are normal cats ?

Terrestrian cats (the smalls one's purring on your sofa) are parts of the GROS_CHAT
The GROS_CHAT is not very busy: as he is the THINGS he has nothing to interact with.

As GROS_CHAT is everything, GROS_CHAT has then very few distractions.
GROS_CHAT naps a lot but still need some distraction.

GROS_CHAT made very small creature at his image : we call them **cats**, they live on earth.
They were made by GROS_CHAT to distract him : as they can watch humans, birds, flies and mouses behaviour it s kind of a massive TV show for GROS_CHAT
They also were made to be fondled : humans fondling a terrestrian cat is still fondling GROS_CHAT, as GROS_CHAT is everything.
In consequence
  fondling a **cat** is fondling GROS_CHAT
  fondling GROS_CHAT is fondling the universe, god, gods, things and loved living objects, dark matter and ...and ...everything
  fondling is cool
