#What are normal cats 

Terrestrian cats (the smalls one's purring on your sofa) are parts of the GROS_CHAT
The GROS_CHAT is not very busy. 
As GROS_CHAT is everything, GROS_CHAT has very few distractions.
GROS_CHAT nap a lot but still need some distraction.

GROS_CHAT made very small creature at GROS_CHAT's image, we call them cats, they live on earth.
They were made by GROS_CHAT to distract him as the can watch humans, birds, flies and mouses beheviour.
They also were made to be fondled : humans fondling a terrestrian cat is still fondling GROS_CHAT, as GROS_CHAT is everything.
