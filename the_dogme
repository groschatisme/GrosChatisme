#The GROS_CHAT is everything
#Everything is the GROS_CHAT

  * we -human- are part (small parts) of the GROS_CHAT
  * the universe is part of the GROS_CHAT
  * black hole, dark matter and things beyond the limits of the universe are still part of the GROS_CHAT
  * terrestrian small cats are part of the GROS_CHAT

GROS_CHAT care about napping and watching things happens.
GROS_CHAT is everything, so logically smarter than the sum of the smarters stuffs and living objects of the universe.
As an higly superior mind, GROS_CHAT do nothing and let things happens.
Life, trigonometry, quantum physics or everything are random stuffs. 
Human living are too part of this random, but are still one s of the more efficient living objetcs for fondling
